Time Series Analysis is a technique used to analyze sequences of data points recorded at specific time intervals. It is essential for understanding the patterns, 
trends, and structures in temporal nature of data and helps forecasting future trends.
Important components of Timeseries Analysis are Trend, Seasonality and cyclic patterns (Temporal pattern). Statistical nature of timeseries data is repetitive
or in other terms the residuals (difference between observed and predicted value) at one time stamp are correlated with another timestamp.
